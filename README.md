## Angular Advanced Searchbox

This is a complete rewrite of https://github.com/dnauck/angular-advanced-searchbox to TypeScript and SCSS. Should be easy to convert to Angular 2 because of conversion from a directive to a component.

NOTE: There are some heavy API and behaviour changes, like: deletion of the timeout before model update (this implies usage of a search button), usage of underscore.js and more. May introduce more bugs.
